#Story
GSB_Gym_bot is a telegram bot the idea of which has firstly come in the end of 2021.
During our course "Creative problem solving" we had to make a project which
could be useful for GSB HSE. Me and my team has decided to introduce the 
idea of the gym in the GSB and to make it easier to sugnup for session we wanted to make
a telegramm bot. Unfortunately than we did not have knowledge to do that. However,
in the cureent studying year this bot finally could be created, unfortunately just by myself.

## Usage

The usage principle is very simple:

1. You are greeted by the bot.
2. You have a small menu bar where you can se the upcoming events in the gym or sign up for the session.
3. What happens in the events session has to be seen by urself)))
4. In the signup session you can choose weather you want to train individually or with a group
5. Than you can choose the day you want to train at
6. The last step is choosing time for ur training
7. Congrats, u r done

## What is pseudo db?
Since we did not study the way we can connect to the database the role of primitive DB serves a glovbal dict 
from the pseudo db module. Unfortunately, it serves just for 1 iteration((
